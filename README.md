For now the miller indices and calculations for xrd plots are not implemented in code. 

In saved figures the labels overlap, when running the code, the figures can be zoomed in and everything is nicely visible. For overlapping reference peaks the labels still overlap, but then the indices can be checked in original .xlsx file
